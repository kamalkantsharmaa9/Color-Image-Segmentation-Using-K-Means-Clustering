# Color-Image-Segmentation-Using-K-Means-Clustering
This Machine Learning Project uses K-Means Clustering Algorithm for extracting features as the cluster color centeres on the image and then changes the color of each cluster with the mean color so that we end up with a segmented image.

Technologies Used: K-Means Clustering Algorithm, Numpy, Pandas, Open CV, Image Preprocessing, Python.
